# About CluedIn
CluedIn is the Cloud-native Master Data Management Platform that brings data teams together enabling them to deliver the foundation of high-quality, trusted data that empowers everyone to make a difference. 

We're different because we use enhanced data management techniques like [Graph](https://www.cluedin.com/graph-versus-relational-databases-which-is-best) and [Zero Upfront Modelling](https://www.cluedin.com/upfront-versus-dynamic-data-modelling) to accelerate the time taken to prepare data to deliver insight by as much as 80%. Installed in as little as 20 minutes from the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-gb/marketplace/apps/cluedin.azure_cluedin?tab=Overview), CluedIn is fully integrated with [Microsoft Purview](https://www.cluedin.com/product/microsoft-purview-mdm-integration?hsCtaTracking=461021ab-7a38-41a3-93dd-cfe2325dfd35%7Cb835efc0-e9b7-4385-a1b6-75cb7632527b) and the full [Microsoft Fabric](https://www.cluedin.com/microsoft-fabric) suite, making it the preferred choice for [Azure customers](https://www.cluedin.com/microsoft-intelligent-data-platform).
